### Technology Stack

- Cypress for Backend and Frontend Automation Testing
- NodeJS
- Javascript
- NPM as Build Tool
- Cucumber BDD as development approach
- Cucumber Preprocessor as Test Runner
- VS Code

## Framework Layers mapping

1. The Utilities & Resources Layer (L1): common folder for step definitions, support,fixtures,environments , cypress.json and plugins
2. The Pages / Microservices Layer (L2): pages and step definitions
